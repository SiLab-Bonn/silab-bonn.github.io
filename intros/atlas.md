The [**ATLAS**](https://home.cern/science/experiments/atlas) experiment is one of two general purpose detectors at the LHC in Geneva and responsible for the discovery of the Higgs Boson in 2012. To maintain the discovery potential for new physics for one of the larges detectors ever built, an upgrade for ATLAS is foreseen in 2029. The Silizium Labor in Bonn is involved in the development of the ATLAS inner tracker (ITK) system, at the heart of ATLAS, only a few millimeters away from the interaction point. We have contributed to the development and testing of the newly designed hybrid pixel readout chip (ATLAS ITkPix) including chip verification, development of test systems and wafer level tests. Currently, the main focus is the development of test stands in order to test detector modules during the production phase. During this two-year phase (starting in 2024), approximately 1000 detector modules have to be extensively tested in the Silizium Labor before insertion into the final detector at CERN.
