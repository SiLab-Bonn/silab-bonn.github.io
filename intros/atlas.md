The [**ATLAS**](https://home.cern/science/experiments/atlas) experiment is one of two general purpose detectors at the LHC in Geneva and responsible for the discovery of the Higgs Boson in 2012. To maintain the discovery potential for new physics for one of the larges detectors ever built, an upgrade for ATLAS is foreseen in 2026. Bonn is involved in the replacement of the ATLAS inner tracker (ITK) system, at the heart of ATLAS, only a few millimeters away from the interaction point. In this project Bonn is contributing to the chip design, verification and testing of the next generation of [hybrid pixel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_pixel_detector) readout chips.
