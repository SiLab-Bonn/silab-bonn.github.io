# Depleted Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors

Monolithic pixel detectors are a rather novel approach that combine the sensor (where charges are created) and the readout part (digitization) on the same wafer.
This approach makes costly production steps like combining two different chips for sensor and readout redundant.

The development from our group (in collaboration with CERN and institutes from France) focuses on building such monolithic devices with radiation hardness and timing capabilities comparable to the requirements of ATLAS outer pixel layers.
