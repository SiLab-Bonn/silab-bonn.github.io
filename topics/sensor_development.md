- Description: SiC (Silicon-Carbide) is a semiconductor that provides several interesting characteristics when operated as a particle detector. It is insensitive to visible light, has lower leakage current compared to silicon and can be operated at high temperatures. Two sets of SiC pad diodes of different thicknesses, namely 40 µm and 110 µm, have been designed and fabricated.
- Task: A full electrical characterization, including IV- and CV characteristics, needs to be performed. Followingly, the diodes behavior, operated as a detector (sensor), can be quantified using radioactive sources.
- Tools: Multiple measurement instruments, python
